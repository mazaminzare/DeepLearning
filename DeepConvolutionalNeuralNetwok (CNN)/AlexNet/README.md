# AlexNet
## The architecture consists of eight layers
1.	Five convolutional layers
2.	Three fully-connected layers
## Special advantages
1.	ReLU Nonlinearity
2.	Multiple GPUs
3.	Overlapping Pooling
4.	Alleviate the overfitting Problem with Data Augmentation and Dropout
5.	Local response normalization (based on AlexNet article this is not trainable. This is just beneficial for overfitting, but today's experiments show that it does not have any effect).
## AlexNet special disadvantages
1.	Less depth to learn features from image sets compared to new models.
2.	Higher convegence time compared to new models
